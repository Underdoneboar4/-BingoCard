# Rush-Hour
A small project

Created by Blake Branvold and Varun Saini
README.md written from Varun's Perspective

Rush Hour, based on the popular board game of the same name, is a simple app that is still in its early stages of development. Blake and I are currently working on a way to define Car objects and give them coordinates on the playing board. After we do this, we will likely perfect game generation and work on graphics.
