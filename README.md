# Rush-Hour
A small project

Created by Blake Branvold and Varun Saini
README.md written from Varun's Perspective

Rush Hour, based on the popular board game of the same name, is a simple app that is still in its early stages of development. The end goal for Rush Hour is to have an electronic version of the board game that is fully functional.
